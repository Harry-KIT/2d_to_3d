# Transition From 2D GANs to 3D GANs

---------
**2D-WGAN** is a variant of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework that introduces the Wasserstein distance as a measure of discrepancy 
between the generated and real data distributions. WGAN aims to address some of the limitations of traditional GANs, such as mode collapse 
and instability during training.

---------
**3D-WGAN** (3D Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network) is a variant of WGAN specifically designed for generating three-dimensional (3D) data, 
such as volumetric images or point clouds. It extends the principles of WGAN to the domain of 3D data generation. 3D-WGAN has been utilized 
in various applications, including 3D medical imaging, computer graphics, and virtual reality.
